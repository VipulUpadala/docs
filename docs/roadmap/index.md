The following items are currently planned as part of the upcoming Tide roadmap. Note that we're using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to manage Tide and that you may need to install the [ZenHub Browser Extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to see all the details within the Tide roadmap.

##  Tide version 1.0.0
* Goal: Provides better SDKs for open source contributors to utilize in coding further Go solutions for Tide on GCP
* Goal: Provides easier integration point (via Webhook/HTTP Listener) for .ORG
* Goal: Provides documentation and working examples of Tide to help developers and contributors better utilize and improve Tide via demonstration website.
* Goal: Begins integration on .ORG (via PHP Compatability results) and first step in actually improving the quality of code on 30% of the web.
* Agile planning: [View in GitHub](https://github.com/wptide/wptide#boards?releases=5b030c381a00905b6c50f1df&repos=107737502), [View in ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/wptide/wptide/boards?releases=5b030c381a00905b6c50f1df&repos=107737502)
